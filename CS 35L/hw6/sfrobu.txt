HW 6

1. Once we've written sfrob using system calls (now sfrobu), we compile it, and then we test it by inputting the bigfile we created for the Lab assignment using the time command:

$ gcc -std=c99 -o sfrobu sfrobu.c
$ time ./sfrobu <bigfile.txt

Output:

real    0m6.987s
user    0m0.347s
sys     0m6.474s

And we compare this output with with the assignment from last week, sfrob:

$ gcc -std=c99 -o sfrob sfrob.c
$ time ./sfrob <bigfile.txt

real    0m2.159s
user    0m0.209s
sys     0m0.262s
