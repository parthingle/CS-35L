Lab 9:

1. First we setup the lab environment to verify if the required repositories are present on the machine:

in Ubunbtu:

$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

openssh-client			install


The openssh server and client are missing. We download and install them:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client


When I'm the server:


First, we generate the public and private keys:

$ ssh-keygen

It asks me to name the file that'll store the passwords, and then asks me to enter the password twice for confirmation. For now, I've kept the password as empty strings.

Then, we create an account for the lab partner. For simplicity, I set the password as "passzhang" for him:

$ sudo useradd -d /home/zhang -m zhang
$ sudo passwd zhang

> passzhang


Then, we create the .ssh directory for the lab partner:

$ mkdir /home/zhang
$ cd /home/zhang
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

Then, we change the ownership and permission on the .ssh directory so the lab partner can access it remotely:

$ sudo chown -R zhang .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh


Now the server work is done. I entered ifconfig to get my IP address which I shared with my lab partner, who then followed the cient side instructions that I followed (When he used his own credentials to 'log into' my server). 


When I acted as the client

Just like the server, we first generate the public and private keys:

$ssh-keygen

Again, for simplicity, I stored it in a file called ssh_pass, and set empty strings as the password.

Then, we copy the public key to the server for key-based authentication

$ ssh-copy-id -i ingle@<partner_IP> (10.97.85.167)

Then we add the private key to authentication agent:

$ ssh-add

After that, we SSH to the lab partner's server by enabling :
X11 forwarding 

$ ssh -X ingle@<partner IP> 

Finally, to test if the connection worked, I try to run firefox on the server:

$ firefox

It works!!

To confirm, I enter ifconfig on my (the client) machine, and get the IP address of my partner (the server).
