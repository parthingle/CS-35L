Lab 2 Log

1. Download the given webpage using wget, and paste the contents into a file called hwords

2. The assignment requires us to strip the webpage of unnecessary items like the brief introduction at the begininning, and a small paragraph at the end. 

3. Once those paragraphs are deleted, we must clean up the blankspaces that will get formed at the top. 

4. Then, we must systematically strip the webpage of things like html tags, unnecessary words within parentheses and other comments that are not required.

5. The next step is to convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, as that is required by the spec.

6. In the Hawaii'an language, the accents are made with a special king of apostrophe. We have to replace them with the regular single quote character ( ' )

7. To format the file after making the aforementioned omissions, a shell command to convert all successive NLC ( '\n' ) into a single NLC.

8. The final substantive command that we have to execute is to remove any words that contain letters NOT found in the Hawaii'an language.



Noted Error:

	The word "woman" is an english word, but co-incidentally only contains letters found in the Hawaii'an alphbet. This is why this word slips through the filters and can still be found in the final hwords file
